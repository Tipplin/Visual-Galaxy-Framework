## Background:
### Every time I work on some project, I always find myself digging through books and 
### my old files to see how I did one or another piece of code.
### Although it works, it usually requires a lot of time. 
### Sites like CodeProject keeps code always available, but if I am offline or on a remote location without the connectivity, 
### then I have always wanted a application that keeps the code organized and handy.
