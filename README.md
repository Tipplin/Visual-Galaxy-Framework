## Introduction

organized Namespaces, Classes, Methods in a hierarchical manner.
#### Use for any Project, any Application.

## Background:
Every time I work on some project, I always find myself digging through books and 
my old files to see how I did one or another piece of code.
Although it works, it usually requires a lot of time. 
Sites like CodeProject keeps code always available, but if I am offline or on a remote location without the connectivity, 
then I have always wanted a application that keeps the code organized and handy.
