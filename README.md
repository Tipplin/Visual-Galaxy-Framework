## Background:
#### Every time I work on some project, I always find myself digging through books and 
#### my old files to see how I did one or another piece of code.

#### Sites like CodeProject keeps code always available, but if I am offline or on a remote location without the connectivity, 
#### then I have always wanted a application that keeps the code organized and handy.
